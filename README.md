# Weather App

A beautiful and functional weather application for iOS that provides real-time weather information for any location.

## ðŸ¤– AI-Assisted Development

**This project was entirely created with the assistance of Cursor's AI coding assistant.** The AI helped with every aspect of development, from initial architecture design to final implementation, demonstrating the power of AI-assisted software development.

The AI assistant contributed to:
- Complete architecture design and implementation
- UI/UX improvements and responsive design
- API integration with OpenWeather
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimization
- Clean code organization and best practices
- Dynamic UI elements that adapt to weather conditions
- Temperature unit conversion functionality
- City search improvements for international locations
- Background image transitions based on weather conditions
- Adaptive text colors for readability across different backgrounds

This project showcases how AI can be a powerful collaborator in software development, helping to create a polished, production-ready application with modern design principles and robust functionality.
